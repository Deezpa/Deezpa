# 👩‍💻 Dr. Deepa Shukla | Machine Learning & Responsible AI Researcher  

**PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning & Responsible AI, 2025)** | Independent Director (IICA, Govt. of India) | Open Science Advocate  

I specialize in **fairness-aware, interpretable AI models** for credit scoring, carbon scoring, and financial technology applications.  
My research integrates **alternative datasets** (psychometric, digital, utility, rural carbon data) to build Responsible AI systems aligned with **global ESG and sustainability goals**.  

I curate the **DeepaShukla Dataverse – Digital Credit Scoring** (Harvard Dataverse) and maintain multiple GitHub repositories to ensure **open, reproducible research**.
